# Guess the Price Game

## Description

The **Guess the Price Game** is a simple game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 1000. On each attempt, the game will indicate whether the guessed price is higher or lower than the target number. The goal is to find the exact number, and once it's found, a "Play Again" button will allow the user to restart the game.
